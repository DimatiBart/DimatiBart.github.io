            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Tor White. Global Creative Director STA Travel</em><br />
<strong>Last year, STA Travel and Tourism Philippines embarked upon a pioneering new project. Philippines Unplugged would document the journey of British band Skinny Living as they traveled through the island province of Palawan. Raw, unscripted and all-access, this film series would show the beauty and honesty of the Philippines. The footage and photography would capture a world of authentic people and unfamiliar places; and the lyrics would tell their story, with Skinny Living writing an exclusive track for us on the road.</p>
<p>Here are our highlights behind the cameras and the music.<br />
&#8220;Come take a trip with me&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Ryan, Rhys, Danny and Will are Skinny Living &#8211; our first STA Travel Sounds artists from back in 2015. From smashing our Sounds stage at Bestival on the Isle of Wight, to playing in a converted railway carriage in Cornwall as part of our Airbnb film series, together we&#8217;ve worked on some incredible projects.</p>
<p>However, none would depict the relationship between music, travel and discovery like this one. The band hadn’t been to Asia before, let alone to the remote Filipino island of Palawan, and the experience was transformative. From the madness of tricycles on mud roads, to making music at sunrise on the beach; watching the story unfold from behind the scenes and behind the camera was incredible.</p>
<p>We interacted with everything, and the influences were many. But here are a few that really hit us.</p>
<h3>A local affair</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image1.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image1.jpg" alt="" title="BlogB_Image1" width="620" height="420" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39108" /></a></p>
<p>From the school kids who sang their hearts out with us at their school on a secluded island, to the chilled and friendly folks we met in each village… the Philippines IS the people.</p>
<p><span id="more-39097"></span></p>
<h3>The “aliveness”</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image2.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image2.jpg" alt="" title="BlogB_Image2" width="620" height="420" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39109" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no other way to describe it. Tropic storms that rolled off the surf into the luscious greenery… you could almost feel the jungle growing in front of your eyes.</p>
<h3>Being a group</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image3.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image3.jpg" alt="" title="BlogB_Image3" width="620" height="420" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39110" /></a></p>
<p>Travelling as part of a tour didn&#8217;t give us less independence &#8211; but more. Being able to “switch off” and be free from figuring out where to be and what to do, especially in our limited time,<br />
meant we could just “be” and experience the adventure as it happened.</p>
<p>Oh, and something else got a good view of the band&#8217;s first experience of the Philippines. The drone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image4.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BlogB_Image4.jpg" alt="" title="BlogB_Image4" width="620" height="512" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39111" /></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at STA Travel, we understand that when it comes to drinking (responsibly, of course) there are usually four different types of ‘sessions’ you could be feeling on any number of days. You’ve got the day drinking session, which is something you tend to go for when it’s nice and sunny outside or you’ve got enough time to get over the hangover before work the following day (hello Sunday sessions!). Then you’ve got the pre-drinking session, whether that’s something you do at Uni in order to make your night out cheaper, or you’re just wanting to go to a few places and get in the mood before you head to the main place. Then you’ve got the classy and sophisticated session, where you’re thinking of just going to dinner and a few drinks, maybe some cocktails a la Sex and the City. Last but not least you’ve got the ‘out out’ session where you’re planning on going hard (and not going home).<br />
We’re delving into the nightlife (or day drinking life) of Surfers Paradise, and have grouped our top venues in terms of these four sessions.</p>
<h3>Day drinking</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7871" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/unsplash.com_beer.jpg.jpg" alt="unsplash.com_beer.jpg" width="620" height="413" /><br />
Who doesn’t love to go out on a sunny day and sit in a beer garden with friends, catching up, laughing and just generally having a great time? Australia does day drinking very well, it’s probably to do with their laid-back attitude, great weather, and beach front locations. Surfers Paradise ticks all three of these boxes, and here’s some of our top picks for a good day drinking session:<br />
<span id="more-39083"></span></p>
<p><strong>HOUSE OF BREWS</strong><br />
If you can’t tell from the name, this place is all about the beers (they have over 30 to choose from) add a rooftop cocktail bar, some live music, a big BBQ and a casual dress code and you’ve got yourself a pretty epic day drinking venue.</p>
<p><strong>SURFERS SANDBAR</strong><br />
Another place that is all about the beers, Surfers Sandbar is a classic Aussie beach bar, very chilled out with a good view of the ocean, and to top it off it also has a brekky buffet every day of the week … so really you could start in the morning if you wanted to. PAAAAAAACE YOURSELF.</p>
<p><strong>SURFERS PARADISE BEER GARDEN</strong><br />
The name says it all really, every word attracts us. Surfers, yes. Paradise, of course. Beer, yes please. Garden, cute. This place is known affectionately by the locals as “the beery” and is a loungey place where you can enjoy a bit of sunshine day drinking into the night &#8211; or even predrinking &#8211; it’s got a casual dress code, live bands, large balconies to hang out on, jugs of beer, pub grub and good vibes … what more do you need?</p>
<h3>Pre-drinking</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC01633_Croatia_Busabout_FAM_trip_-_2015.jpg" alt="DSC01633_Croatia_Busabout_FAM_trip_-_2015" width="620" height="416" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7868" /><br />
Sometimes you need a good pre-drinking bar to get you and your mates in the mood before a night out, or if you don’t tend to actually head to the main bar ‘til 12 then you need somewhere to hang out beforehand. Enter these venues:</p>
<p><strong>CENTRAL LOUNGE BAR AND DINING</strong><br />
A good place for all occasions, with meals, desserts and drinks (not to mention DESSERT COCKTAILS!) and of course it’s centrally located, if they didn’t make that obvious enough. Perfect position for a pre-place.</p>
<p><strong>HOWL AT THE MOON</strong><br />
This place has a tapas menu created by none other than celebrity chef Guy Grossi, with live musicians performing old school songs to sing your heart out to, DJ’s playing mainstream tunes, an outdoor balcony overlooking the river, and daybeds to relax on if you fancy starting your night even earlier. It’s actually a good place to start or end your night, but we’re gonna go for start.</p>
<p><strong>AVENUE RESTAURANT AND SALOON</strong><br />
They describe themselves as “a destination to dine, drink and party ‘til your feet fall off” and that’s exactly what you can do here. You’ve got a pizza oven cooking ‘til 2am, so you don’t even have to wander out to find the local takeaway. There are live music and comedy acts every day of the week, including DJ’s and MC’s. A great place to start your night, or even spend your entire night if you wanted to. We were sold at the mention of pizza ‘til 2am…</p>
<h3>Classy and sophisticated/dinner and chill</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_256456165.jpg" alt="shutterstock_256456165" width="620" height="430" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7869" /><br />
Sometimes you just want to feel a bit flashy, get dressed up, and have some quieter drinks to catch up with your friends (and maybe some dinner thrown in too). Well Surfers Paradise isn’t just about crazy and tacky night clubs, they do sophistication too:</p>
<p><strong>STRINGRAY LOUNGE</strong><br />
This is part of QT hotels and resorts, so you know it’s a good one. A classy little lounge bar, where the dress code is ‘dress to impress’. They have a resident DJ, a unique cocktail list, quirky furniture and industrial design. Sounds intriguing doesn’t it? Well throw in the fact they do Taco Tuesdays too …. sold!</p>
<p><strong>SKY POINT</strong><br />
Having cocktails in the world’s tallest residential tower, with 360 degree views of the Gold Coast, it doesn’t get much classier than that. They play some seriously smooth beats and are damn good at fixing up a great cocktail too.</p>
<p><strong>BLACK COFFEE LYRICS</strong><br />
If you like something that is a bit different to your classic cocktail bar then it’s worth checking out this cool and quirky place. It’s hidden away in the upstairs of the centre arcade on the boulevard, so you have to know about it to find it (you’re welcome). It’s a boutique kinda bar, with live jazz, antique furniture, a laid-back atmosphere, a whole lotta rum bourbon and whisky, PLUS coffee cocktails! Definitely a one for the cool kids.</p>
<h3>Out Out</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ThinkstockPhotos-467467892.jpg.jpg" alt="ThinkstockPhotos-467467892.jpg" width="620" height="414" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7870" /><br />
This is for the hard core partiers among you, the ones who are always going “out out”:</p>
<p><strong>ELSEWHERE</strong><br />
If you’re all about the alternative EDM, then go ‘elsewhere’ – see what we did there? This is an interesting and eclectic hipster hang out, that looks so cool it’s been used as a backdrop for fashion labels, commercial TV and even National Geographic! They care a lot about what they stand for and collaborate with cultural events and music festivals so they’re always bringing their A game. Check out their website for their cool and quirky events.</p>
<p><strong>SIN CITY</strong><br />
Exactly what it says on the tin – this place is full of sin! Couches that look suspiciously like beds, topless waiters, waitresses in underwear, and cages and podiums to shake what your momma gave you. It’s got some world-class multi-million dollar décor, and is a haunt for A-List celebs like Chris Brown and Lil Jon. With an exclusive Cîroc bar, and ladies nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it would be rude not to check out this “playground for gold coast socialites”.</p>
<p><strong>THE RUBY TRAMP</strong><br />
Completely the opposite of trampy, this place is definitely an upmarket lounge bar. Although you’d be expecting this in the ‘classy and sophisticated’ section of this post, the place is pretty slow until 11pm when people fill in and start the party. It’s got a trendy, rustic style (leather lounges, coffee tables, fireplace, deer heads, antique lamps), and it’s all about the electro tunes. A contrast that definitely works for them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget the Hollywood Sign, Empire State Building and Grand Canyon! We&#8217;re here to share with you those little hidden gems you&#8217;ve never thought about visiting in the USA. From prisons housing the world&#8217;s most infamous criminals to speakeasies hidden behind telephone boxes, museums full of shrunken heads and sleepy sloth sanctuaries, here&#8217;s our pick of 7 alternative places to visit in the USA in 2017&#8230;</p>
<h2>1. Antelope Canyon</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7778" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/antelope-canyon-better.jpg" alt="antelope canyon " width="620" height="630" /><br />
<span id="more-39077"></span></p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Arizona, located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Due to its high levels of flash flooding Antelope Canyon is a particularly dangerous spot to visit. So dangerous it can only be reached with the help of a tour guide. However, thanks to millions of years&#8217; worth of wind and water erosion Antelope Canyon&#8217;s sandstone is smooth, flowing and just downright gorgeous, making it one of the most photographed and visited slot canyons in America. Just THINK of those Instagrams!</p>
<h2>2. Alcatraz</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7780" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alcatrazzzzz.jpg" alt="Alcatraz" width="620" height="630" /></p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>San Francisco Bay, California</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>In all its 29 years of operation no prisoner has ever successfully escaped this prison&#8230; or so they claim! Also known as &#8216;The Rock&#8217;, Alcatraz held many famous American criminals such as Al Capone, Bumpy Johnson, George “Machine Gun” Kelly, and Robert Franklin Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz). Take a tour and learn all about its rich history or for a bit of extra spook opt for the night tour!</p>
<h2>3. A Sloth Sanctuary</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7782" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sloth-happy.jpg" alt="sloth" width="620" height="530" /></p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Rainer, Oregon</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Just look at his little, smiling sloth face! How could you not want to go? Sloth Captive Husbandry Centre in Oregon is home to the largest captive population of adult sloths in the WORLD! The guys over at the sloth centre are dedicated to the care and research on these unusual animals. The centre allows small groups to have up close encounters with the sloths. Imagine meeting the world&#8217;s most chilled out animal?</p>
<h2>4. Telsa Coil at Griffith Observatory</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7789" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/telsa-coil.jpg" alt="telsa coil" width="620" height="630" /></p>
<pre>www.atlasobscura.com</pre>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles, California</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>This is one of the most impressive things you will see at the Griffith Observatory. The Telsa Coil throws out lightning bolts every hour on the hour. Situated in a newly designed alcove of the observatory, the loud zapping noises are amplified for maximum wow factor! Forget ALL about the views on the outside of the observatory.</p>
<h2>5. Please Don&#8217;t Tell</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7791" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Please-dont-tell-entrance.jpg" alt="t Tell speak easy entrance" width="620" height="630" /></p>
<pre>bedfordandbowery.com</pre>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>St. Mark’s Place, New York City</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Well firstly, you have to enter via a telephone box! Even in this social media age, where nothing remains a secret, Please Don&#8217;t Tell seems to do a pretty good job at keeping itself hush hush.  A throwback to the speakeasy, prohibition days Please Don&#8217;t Tell is a glamourous little bar where the menu is unknown until entering. Its website is literally one page with a reservation phone number on it. Head to Crif Dogs, a late night fried hot dog joint, enter via the telephone box, dial the secret telephone number and the most exciting part is about to start!</p>
<h2>The Museum of Weird</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7797" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Museum-of-weird-Austin-Texas.jpg" alt="Museum of weird Austin Texas" width="620" height="430" /></p>
<pre>museumoftheweird.com</pre>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Austin, Texas</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Because dime museums are a dying breed! It may not look like much at first but Austin&#8217;s Museum of Weird is actually a very rare thing indeed. Created by Steve Busti artist and entrepreneur, it&#8217;s situated in the back of his &#8216;Lucky Lizard&#8217; store. The museum houses many curious attractions including the feejee mermaid, a cyclops pig, a hand of glory (dried and pickled hand), two-headed chicken, shrunken heads and a mummies. It may cost a little more than a dime now, but the weirdness is certainly worth it!</p>
<h2>6. San Fran Street Slides</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7794" src="http://www.statravel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/STREET-SLIDES-SAN-FRAN.jpg" alt="STREET SLIDES SAN FRAN" width="620" height="430" /></p>
<pre>sftodo.com</pre>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Seward Street, San Francisco</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Slides. Grown-up slides people! Need we say more? Grab a trusty piece of cardboard, head to Seward Mini-Park and you&#8217;ll discover two giant slides tucked away behind the bushes. The sign on entering says &#8216;Adults must be accompanied by children&#8217;, it&#8217;s a whole heap of fun and a hidden treasure you&#8217;d never expect to find in San Fran!</p>
<h2>7.Cadillac Ranch</h2>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-version="7">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer="defer"></script></p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Amarillo Texas, Route 66</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Because who doesn&#8217;t love a Cadillac art installation? The Cadillac ranch is an iconic pit-stop along Route 66, not far from Amarillo. Also known as the &#8216;Caddy Ranch&#8217; this public artwork display was created in 1974 by artists from San Francisco known as the Ant Farm. They wanted to show off the Cadillac&#8217;s tail fins and perplex the residents of Amarillo. The cars are supposed to be tilted at exactly the same angle as the faces of the Great Pyramid of Khufu, in Egypt! Ever since 1976 visitors have painted graffiti on them, so why not join in and take the ultimate Instagram snap?</p>
<div class="blogfoot">There are so many undiscovered gems in the states. It&#8217;s not always about the tourist hot-spots! What will you discover on your <a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-america.htm" target="_blank">USA adventure</a>?</div>

<p>Forget Sydney, London and New York – Melbourne is the most livable city in the world and this is why…</p>
<p><strong>Best Bars</strong><br />
<em>No.1 &#8211; The Croft Institute - 21 Croft Alley, Melbourne</em><br />
Hidden down a laneway in Chinatown, The Croft Institute is a wonderfully, creepy science lab- inspired bar. Even the toilets look like a mental asylum!<br />
Open 5pm – 1am (Mon –Thurs), 5pm – 3am (Fri -Sat), closed Sunday</p>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-croft-institution-melbourne.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-croft-institution-melbourne.jpg" alt="" title="the-croft-institution-melbourne" width="620" height="433" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39088" /></a></p>

<span id="more-39031"></span></p>
<p><em>No.2 &#8211; Boston Sub / Jungle Boy - 96 Chapel St, Windsor.</em><br />
Don’t be fooled by the exterior fish and chip shop, the big fridge door leads you to an outside bar!<br />
Open 5pm – 1am every day</p>
<p><em>No.3 &#8211; Naked for Satan</em><br />
With a cocktail list larger than a novel and a glorious west facing balcony – this gem will not disappoint.</p>

<p><em>Image: <a href="http://www.nakedforsatan.com.au">nakedforsatan.com.au</a></em></p>
<p><em>No.4 &#8211; Rooftop Bar and Cookie</em><br />
Inspired cocktails and tasty Thai food, with sweeping views of the city at the cleverly named ‘Rooftop Bar’ &#8211; this is bar far one of my favorite destinations for an atmospheric night with friends</p>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rooftop-bar-and-cookie-melbourne.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rooftop-bar-and-cookie-melbourne.jpg" alt="" title="rooftop-bar-and-cookie-melbourne" width="620" height="413" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39087" /></a></p>
<p><em>Image: <a href="http://www.nakedforsatan.com.au">static1.squarespace.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>No.5 &#8211; Asian Beer Café - Melbourne Central Level 3, 211 La Trobe Street Melbourne Central</em><br />
A uni student’s heaven with cheap drinks and meals overlooking the hustle and bustle of Swanston street.<br />
Open 11am – 1pm every day</p>
<p>Feel like exploring…</p>
<p>• Degraves Street- the quintessential Melbournian laneway<br />
• Hosier lane/ACDC lane- street art on steroids<br />
• Fitzroy- vintage clothing and an array of restaurants and cafes<br />
• Lygon Street- love Italian food? Eat here!<br />
• The State Library of Victoria- this historical and picturesque library makes you want to study<br />
• Eureka Skydeck 88 – 360 degree views of Melbourne</p>
<p>No weekend plans? Perfect!<br />
• The free tram zone means you can literally jump on and off where you like<br />
• Federation Square<br />

<h2>Boston</h2>

<p>As the birthplace of the American revolution, Boston is brimming with history. It&#8217;s a city full of culture, charming neighbourhoods, excellent food and interesting locals. Also the country&#8217;s educational capital, it&#8217;s bustling with students and has a cracking nightlife! Head to <strong>Drink</strong> previously voted World&#8217;s Best Cocktail Bar on Congress Street. There&#8217;s no set drinks menu, you literally tell the bar tender what you want or what spirits you like and they&#8217;ll conjure up something you didn&#8217;t even know you liked!</p>
<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> Worth getting the <strong>Boston CityPass</strong> so you can save some serious dollar on the city&#8217;s museums and attractions.</p>

<p>Feel the energy of New York City around the clock and finally understand why it is the city that never sleeps. Considered the epicentre of arts and dining as well as the forefront of fashion &#8211; its compact but jam-packed! Use your own two feet to discover the famous streets and mesmirising <strong>Times Square</strong>. With a diverse population and over 20,000 restaurants you&#8217;re in for a few culinary treats&#8230; head to the 100 year old Jewish delis on Upper West side, grab some steaming dumplings in China Town or a cheesy pizza from Little Italy in Lower Manhattan &#8211; feast yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> Get a <strong>7-day Unlimited Subway Pass</strong> for easy travel around the city for around $31</p>
<h2>Philadelphia</h2>

<p>Often ignored for its bigger brother in the north and the capital in the south, Philadelphia is underrated yet awesome. The name translates as the <strong>&#8216;City of Brotherly Love&#8217;</strong> in Greek and is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the USA. Start at the Independence National Historic Park and check out <strong>Independence Hall</strong> where the Declaration of Independence was signed. The food is fab in Philly; street stalls selling soft pretzels and mustard for 50 cents, Italian deli markets and an incredible Chinatown. Oh and be sure to visit <strong>Society Hill</strong> one of the city’s most picturesque suburbs, very colonial and quaint.</p>
<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> Make sure you get a <strong>&#8216;Cheez Whiz&#8217;</strong> aka the south Philly cheesesteak, wafer-thin roast beef topped with melted cheese &#8211; YUM.</p>
<h2>Washington</h2>

<p>Washington DC is the USA&#8217;s capital full of iconic monuments, museums and political visionaries. Start at the attractions along the <strong>National Mall</strong>; climb the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, check out the Smithsonian Institution (the world&#8217;s largest museum), Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, take a tour of the White House. Also be sure to visit the National Theatre and the Kennedy centre! This city is a historical and cultural mecca.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check out <strong>A&amp;D</strong> for a laid-back, neighbourhood feel and weekday happy hours between 5pm &#8211; 7pm, where you cant get $4 tallboys, $5 drafts and $5 glasses of wine. If you&#8217;re peckish bring in a sandwich from <strong>Sundevich</strong> around the corner, owned by the same duo.</p>
<h2>Orlando</h2>

<p>Venture away from Disney and Universal studios and you&#8217;ll discover there&#8217;s more to Orlando than meets the eye. With its leafy neighbourhoods, incredible performing arts scene, nature preserves and museums, there&#8217;s a surprising slower pace of life that many visitors overlook. Take time out of roller coaster riding to explore the quieter, gentler side of Orlando. For local eateries head <strong>downtown</strong>, <strong>Epcot’s World Showcase</strong> is where you&#8217;ll find the best restaurants at Disneyland and <strong>Yellow Dog Eats</strong> for the tastiest BBQ.</p>
<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> For an old school theme-park, without the fancy roller coasters head to <strong>Gatorland</strong>. Walk around a splintery wooden boardwalk, past hundreds of alligators in their breeding marsh and buy a hotdog to feed them!</p>
<h2>Miami</h2>

<p>Also known as the <strong>&#8216;Magic City&#8217;</strong> because of the spell its glamour and beauty will cast over you. Miami is intoxicatingly beautiful, just look at those palm trees! Miami beach is a golden stretch of sand and home to most of the city&#8217;s Art Deco architecture. With a massive Hispanic population, Miami does Cuban food best try fried plantains and shredded pork sandwiches &#8211; you won&#8217;t regret it! There is also incredibly fresh seafood, <strong>Stonecrab claws</strong> (Oct-May) are a South Florida speciality.</p>
<p><strong>Top tip:</strong> Miami&#8217;s nightlife is some of the best in the entire country. Most of the action is on South Beach, expect to pay a $20 cover charge. <strong>Foxhole Bar</strong> is a little more local and has two-for-one drinks, on weekdays between 5-9pm.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanging out on the beach all day getting your tan on, or grabbing a surfboard and hitting the waves – this is the epitome of the Australian dream. One of the places where you can do all this and more is the Gold Coast. Need further explanation as to why you should visit? You greedy thing, you. Here’s our 11 reasons to get on a plane/in a campervan and get yourself to the east coast of Australia!</p>
<h3>Beaches that are out of this world</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYGold-Coast_014.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYGold-Coast_014.jpg" alt="" title="BODYGold Coast_014" width="620" height="326" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38990" /></a>
<pre>Image: Gold Coast</pre>
<p>If beaches are your thing, the Gold Coast has got you covered. The coastline stretches for 57 kilometres (35 miles) and you can pick from 20 different beaches; what better excuse to take a 20-day holiday than visiting a new Aussie beach every day? Surfers Paradise is probably the most well-known of them all, and is highly distinctive as the skyline is practically on the beach. Then a little further South of Surfers you will find yourself on Mermaid Beach, unfortunately it’s not named after the abundance of mermaids nearby (we were sad too), but it is known for its laid-back appeal, which can be great if you’ve been going crazy in Surfers Paradise for the last few days. You can also take a trip down ‘Millionaire’s Row’, look at the fancy mansions and maybe have a little cry about how much you want one. South of Surfers you’ve got Burleigh Heads, which is famous for its surfing spots (or just for ogling the surfers!), and if you move even further south you’ll find yourself in Coolangatta, another top spot for surfing and a great place to visit if you love the old-school charm of a seaside town.<br />
<span id="more-38986"></span></p>
<h3>Learn to surf</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYGold-Coast_021.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYGold-Coast_021.jpg" alt="" title="BODYGold Coast_021" width="620" height="930" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38991" /></a>
<pre>Image: Gold Coast</pre>
<p>If you didn’t know already – and live under a rock – Australia is famously known for its surfing. So if you’re hoping to pick up the skill on your trip over to the Gold Coast, then you’ve chosen the right place to visit as there are tons of surf schools to choose from in the area. Move over Mick Fanning, there’s a new pro in town.</p>
<h3>Some proper good coffee</h3>

<p>Now we know Melbourne is the most famous in Australia for coffee, but it doesn’t mean that the rest of Australia doesn’t know what it’s doing when it comes to that beautiful cup of liquid gold. We’ve had a look at beanhunter.com because we know addicts people, get pretty serious when it comes to their coffee, and have stolen their list when it comes to the top 4 places for coffee in 2016. Check out First Fruits Coffee in Ashmore, Parlour Coffee in Burleigh Heads, and Percy’s Corner or Raw Espresso in Southport.</p>

<p>If you’ve got 3 hours to spare and you love a good thrill, then look no further than The Canyon Flyer. It’s not only Australia’s longest zip line tour, but it’s also the highest (you can get up to 60m high) and the fastest (you reach speeds of 70km’s per hour!). Our hearts are racing just looking at it!</p>
<h3>Instameets</h3>

<p>Do you love uploading your Instagram with artsy pictures of sunsets, beaches, and anywhere else you happen to go? Have you ever heard of an Instameet? It’s basically where famous Instagrammers will host meet-ups with other Instagrammers – and anyone’s invited! You’ll all meet up somewhere on the GC, go and take a photo of something amazing, learn some tips and tricks to get that perfect Insta photo, and then go for a drink or something after. It’s the event you never knew you needed … til now. Top tip: follow @igersgoldcoast or @visitgoldcoast who are known to host Instameets regularly.</p>

<p>See the Australian rainforest in a slightly different, and incredibly awesome way, by trekking through the lush forest on horseback. Just you, the sound of hooves, the cool rainforest and the stunning views of the valley once you reach the top. And the best news? You don’t need to have horse-riding experience to do it!</p>

Change up traditional island hopping by riding a jet ski and feeling the freedom and exhilaration as you explore the wild blue ocean and the hidden paradise islands. See dolphins, turtles, wallabies and wild pigs before stopping off at a tropical resort on South Stradbroke. Perfect on a sunny day – which is pretty much all the time on the GC.</p>

<p>From arts and crafts to food, and farmers markets to car boot sales, you’ve got loads of markets to choose from on the Gold Coast. Hosted in the Hinterland, along the beaches and in the suburbs, you’re sure to pass at least one as you’re wandering around. We’ve been kind to you, as we always are, and hand-picked a few for you to check out: TVM (The Village Markets) known as a ‘creative hub’ for emerging entrepreneurs, such as Peony Swimwear and F+H Jewellery, this boutique market trades on the first and third Sunday of every month at Burleigh Heads, Broadbeach Markets on the first and third Sunday of every month for interesting arts and crafts, Marketta Street Food – Tapas Club in Miami every Wednesday evening for some food lovin’, or Surfers Paradise Beachfront Markets – one of the biggest on the Gold Coast &#8211; every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.</p>

Not only does the Gold Coast have long stretches of surfer beaches and a huge Hinterland behind it, it’s also home to some pretty amazing theme/water parks. Warner Bros Movie World is exactly what it says on the tin: a theme park with movie-themed rides and a real life Diagon Alley – yep, you heard us. Or if you&#8217;re more of a fan of water parks there&#8217;s also Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild &#8211; time to unleash your inner child!</p>

This breath-taking site is located in the Hinterland, just 45 minutes from the beaches. Take a walk through the wilderness to find waterfalls, lookouts, wildlife and so much more… parts of the park are even UNESCO World Heritage sites. It’s close enough to go on a day trip to the park, but we recommend renting a cottage, cabin or just pitch up a tent under the stars to get a real taste of living out in the jungle.  </p>
<h3>Nightlife</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYPub_188000910.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/BODYPub_188000910.jpg" alt="" title="BODYPub_188000910" width="620" height="522" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-39005" /></a><br />
If you’re partial to an epic night out then look no further than Surfers Paradise. It’s got bars, clubs, nightclubs and pubs, so you’re guaranteed to find something that’s right up your street. Crazy for a cocktail? Check out The Avenue: it’s got quirky cocktails, food fit for foodies and live entertainment (stand-up comedy, acoustic music and gigs). If you’re looking for a nightclub with décor that is so OTT you’ve got to love it, head on over to SinCity Nightclub, a place you might even be able to spot some international artists. Alternatively, if a pub is more your style, then there’s Irish pubs Fiddler’s Green and Waxy’s. If we know one thing, it’s that there’s no experience quite like an Irish pub experience.</p>
<div class="blogfoot">Hopefully this list has inspired you to get out there and start living your Australian dream on the <a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/visit-gold-coast.htm">Gold Coast</a>. Go on, we dare you.</div>

<p>Divorce is just around the corner.</p>
<p>(We’re not being pessimistic, we’re sure you’re very much in love. But the next beach over from Playa del Amor (Lover’s Beach) is Playa del Divorcio (Divorce Beach)).</p>
<h2>Loveland, The Rockies, Colorado</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love is in the air, and it’s in the water too apparently. When you think of a romantic destination, your mind probably wanders to Paris or Venice. Sure, a gondola ride is dreamy way to spend an afternoon but if you want to get really romantic, why not head to a heart-shaped island?</p>
<h2>Tavarua Island, Fiji</h2>

<p>Located in the South Pacific Ocean, Tavarua Island is perhaps the most famous heart shaped island of them all. As well as being home to a luxurious all-inclusive resort, this island also boasts being a world class surf destination.</p>

<p>Heart Reef can be found in the Great Barrier Reef off Whitsunday Islands but can only be appreciated from the sky due to its protected status. Because it’s just that special!</p>

<p>It wasn’t until this island was found on Google Earth back in 2009 that it became a huge tourist destination. It’s only small, but that’s the main part of it’s charm. Which gives you the perfect excuse to un-invite that third wheel friend of yours. There’s just no room for them.</p>
<h2>Blueberry Island, Canada</h2>

<p>45 minutes north of Montreal lies the cutely named Blueberry Island. You may have some trouble finding a place to stay though as it’s only accommodation is a red cedar log cabin.</p>
<h2>Heart-shaped Island, Lake Walchensee, Germany</h2>

<p>Found in the Bavarian Alps, this pretty island sits on Lake Walchensee, one of the deepest and largest lakes in Germany. Its existence is still a secret, even among the citizens of Munich!</p>

<p>You can’t take a trip to Hollywood and NOT talk a walk down this famous street. Find your favourite celebs and snap some iconic photos, just like this one. Maybe you’ll even catch a star ceremony! The newest addition to the walk of fame is the ever so dreamy Adam Levine from Maroon 5.</p>

This needs no words. Ok maybe it needs a few: this is a classic iconic photo opportunity, enough said.</p>
<h3>Santa Monica Pier</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Santa-Monica-Pier-002.jpg"><img src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Santa-Monica-Pier-002.jpg" alt="" title="Santa Monica Pier (002)" width="620" height="523" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38889" /></a></p>
<p>The pier that’s got everything, fun, food and history. Go for a ride on the historic carousel, jump on the ferris wheel, listen to some live music, get some shrimp from Bubba Gump’s, and soak up all the coastal vibes that the West Coast has to offer.</p>
<h3>Cruise along Orange County</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/California_BUSA_SOP_17A0607.jpg-002.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38807" title="California_BUSA_SOP_17A0607.jpg (002)" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/California_BUSA_SOP_17A0607.jpg-002.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Soak up a little more of that West Coast feeling by cruising along the waterfront of Orange County, sneaking a peek at the beautiful beach towns and beautiful people enjoying their lives.</p>
<h3>Old Town San Diego</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gaslamp-Quarters.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38824" title="Gaslamp Quarters" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gaslamp-Quarters.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Image: <a href="https://cdn.trolleytours.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/san-diego-gaslamp-quarter.jpg">Gaslamp Quarters</a><br />
If you’re into your history then Old Town in San Diego should be at the top of your list. Head to the Downtown district to check out tons of historical sites, old school buildings, the most haunted house in America (Whaley House) and the cool and quirky live music venues and bars of the Gaslamp Quarter’s.</p>
<h3>San Diego Zoo</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/San-Diego-Zoo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38825" title="San Diego Zoo" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/San-Diego-Zoo.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="350" /></a><br />
Image: <a href="https://i.gse.io/gse_media/114/10/1416263697-venue-SDzoo.jpg?p=1">San Diego Zoo</a><br />
Where Ross sent his monkey friend Marcel (in Friends – and if you aren’t aware of this, or you aren’t a Friends fan … well, we won’t even go there). It is home to 4,000 animals and the zoo is well-known for their conservation efforts to save endangered species such as the Rhino and the African Elephant.</p>
<h3>“Valley of the Sun”</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Air-Ballooning.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38826" title="Air Ballooning" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Air-Ballooning.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="258" /></a><br />
Image: <a href="https://arizonahotairballoons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/666.jpg">Hot Air Ballooning across Sonoran Desert</a><br />
From the cool city of San Diego to the beautiful Phoenix, and the Sonoran Desert to be more precise. This huge desert spans around 100,000 square miles of land, so what better way to get a birds-eye view of this impressive place than jumping into a hot air balloon?! Imagine the views – and also the champagne breakfast.</p>
<h3>Sedona</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sedona.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38827" title="Sedona" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Sedona.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="321" /></a><br />
Image: <a href="http://www.sedonareal.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hero-sedona-main.jpg">Sedona</a><br />
A red-rock desert town in Arizona, deep into the Wild West. Conde Nast ranked it as one of the most beautiful towns in America – and that says it all really. Hop in a jeep, driven by real-life cowboys (cowboys who drive jeeps, who’d have thunk it?) and cruise around, taking in all of the magnificent views.</p>
<h3>Grand Canyon</h3>

The route was/is: LA &#8211; San Diego &#8211; Phoenix &#8211; Grand Canyon &#8211; Las Vegas &#8211; Yosemite &#8211; San Francisco. Just 3 days left. Some of the group left today, which was really sad, as you can do the trip in different sections. Very excited to see Yosemite &#8211; just have the 8-hour road trip ahead of me. Beautiful views right now though, of the Mojave Nature Reserve. #grandcanyon #sunrise</a></p>

Of course the Canyon has to be on this list, because look at it! Whatever time of day you go, you’ll be impressed by the landscape, but we recommend either taking a helicopter ride to really appreciate the full site OR go check it out at sunrise … or both if you’re really feeling it. Once in a lifetime right?</p>
<h3>Route 66</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/route66_o6i0808-002.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38808" title="route66_o6i0808 (002)" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/route66_o6i0808-002.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="930" /></a><br />
Another classic Instagram snap.</p>
<h3>Seligman on Route 66</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Seligman3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38821" title="Seligman" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Seligman3.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="245" /></a><br />

A historic stop-off that was on the original Route 66 and is considered the birthplace of the famous route. With 1940’s shop fronts and motels, you’ll be transported back in time when you visit this quaint little town, where you can take away some “old west” souvenirs from the saloon. If you’re feeling hungry, maybe stop off here for lunch at the Roadkill Café … buffalo burger or highway hash anyone?</p>
<h3>Vegas sign</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_277430717-002.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38809" title="shutterstock_277430717 (002)" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_277430717-002.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></a><br />
You’ve just arrived back from the desert and you know you have arrived at the strip of Las Vegas when you spot that giant sign. What’s the first thing you should do? Get a photo of it of course!</p>
<h3>Gamble in Vegas</h3>

<p><script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" defer="defer" type="text/javascript"></script>After the photo it’s straight into the neon lights and crazy nightlife of Vegas. What better way to do that than a trip to one of the many casinos, try your hand at poker or black jack, or even just the slot machines if you’re not entirely sure how to play like a pro. Visit Caesars Palace or the Bellagio and see where ‘The Hangover’ took place…and maybe even be hungover the following day. Unleash your wild side!</p>

If you’re not quite feeling the whole eloping to Vegas and getting married vibe, maybe just go there and see what it’s all about. Elvis-themed weddings – what’s not to love? Maybe you’ll even meet ‘Elvis’ himself.</p>
<h3>The highest observation wheel in the world</h3>

Want a proper view of the city? Then hop on the observation wheel for some magnificent 360 degree views – all those lights make for a very vibrant view (and another great photo opp!)</p>
<h3>Bass Lake</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bass-Lake2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38838" title="Bass Lake" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bass-Lake2.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="281" /></a><br />
Image: <a href="http://http://www.basslake.com/resourcefiles/homeimages/summer-pic.jpg">Bass Lake Chalet</a><br />
A beautiful expanse of water in the Sierra Nevada Mountains; take time out after your mental visit to Vegas and unwind in a lakefront chalet overlooking Bass Lake. Total bliss and relaxation.</p>
<h3>Yosemite National Park</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/USA_San-Francisco_Yosemite_0132.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38839" title="USA_San Francisco_Yosemite_013" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/USA_San-Francisco_Yosemite_0132.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Spend a day discovering the stunning nature of Yosemite by hiring a bike or hiking around the waterfalls, forest, mountains and wildlife. Make sure you remember your camera in case you manage to see black bears, deer or coyotes – and for the magnificent scenery of course!</p>
<h3>Hoover Dam</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NorthAmerica_NationalParks_0022.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38840" title="NorthAmerica_NationalParks_002" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/NorthAmerica_NationalParks_0022.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Another classic visitor spot on the West Coast – a National Historic Landmark. You need to see it to appreciate the effort and work that went into this construction, built during the Depression. It’s definitely <em>not</em> depressing to see the Dam in real life though.</p>
<h3>Golden Gate Bridge</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Gate-Bridge2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38841" title="Golden Gate Bridge" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Golden-Gate-Bridge2.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Next up we’re in the city of San Francisco, and you can’t journey to San Fran without taking a trip to the beautifully orange Golden Gate Bridge. Sit back and watch the sunrise or the sunset over this iconic three-mile-long structure.</p>
<h3>Row houses on Alamo Square</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7479_San-Fran_Ollie-Alli-0022.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38842" title="IMG_7479_San Fran_Ollie Alli (002)" src="http://www.statravel.co.uk/travel-blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7479_San-Fran_Ollie-Alli-0022.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="413" /></a><br />
Want to see what San Fran looked like at the end of the nineteenth century? Why not. ‘The Painted Ladies’ are actually a Victorian row of houses on Alamo Hill. They’re painted in different pastel colours and would make for a great Instagram photo – no filter needed!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you like a city that stands out, stays up and sleeps in, you’ve come to the right place. Mix it with locals and visitors from across the world in back alleys and beer gardens, rooftop bars and hole-in-the-wall restaurants. Take a detour through winding laneways, discover the city’s creative heart, and then resurface to brunch it with the best of them at breezy cafes from St Kilda to Brunswick. Melbourne is the perfect base for your grand Aussie adventure.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve picked our top sporting events and general reason why Melbourne is so great&#8230; *packs bags and moves out*</p>

 Melbourne is officially known as the sporting capital of the world! With over 5 stadiums in the city itself and a sporting event around every corner &#8211; you&#8217;ll be a diehard Melbourne City fan before you know it.</p>
<li><strong><u>MCG Stadium &#8211; The home of cricket and Australian Football League</u></strong>
<p>The Boxing Day Test is the ultimate cricketing event, soak up the electric atmosphere in this 100,000 seated venue. If cricket&#8217;s not your thing, check out an epic AFL game and try to follow this sport&#8217;s crazy rules!</p>
<li><strong><u>Melbourne Park &#8211; The home of tennis</u></strong>
<p>Australian Open is held throughout the month of January, get a $20 ground pass ticket, catch a match in one of the outdoor courts, a bite to eat at the many food stalls and soak up the festival atmosphere. If you want to splash out, get tickets to the Rod Laver court for about $130 and you may get a chance to see some big names!</p>
<li><strong><u>Aami Park &#8211; The home of soccer and rugby</u></strong>
<p>This unique stadium designed almost like a football, is pretty iconic in Melbourne and ensures the crowd don&#8217;t have an obstructed view. You can catch &#8216;Melbourne Storm&#8217; rugby league stars or the &#8216;Melbourne Rebels&#8217; rugby union team, along with Melbourne Victory and Melbourne Heart in the A-League soccer (better known as football) teams &#8211; who needs the Premier League?</p>
<li><strong><u>Flemington Race course &#8211; The home of horse racing</u></strong>
<p>&#8216;The race that stops the nation&#8217; &#8211; The Melbourne Cup. This is one of the biggest days in Australia&#8217;s sporting calendar and most prestigious horse race. There&#8217;s a real carnival atmosphere with food trucks and bars from around the city coming down! It&#8217;s also a day off if you&#8217;re in Victoria, quite literally stops the nation.</p>
